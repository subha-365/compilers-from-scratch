# Learning the Compilation Process

Welcome to my journey of understanding how compilers work! This site documents my hands-on exploration of the compilation process, from lexical analysis to code optimization.

## Topics Covered

* [Lexical Analysis (Lexing)](lexing.md)
* [Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)](parsing.md)
* [Semantic Analysis](semantic_analysis.md)
* [Code Generation](code_generation.md)
* [Optimization](optimization.md)

## About Me

I'm [Your Name], and I'm learning about compilers by building simple implementations and exploring the underlying concepts. This is my public learning journal.
