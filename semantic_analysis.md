# Semantic Analysis

Semantic analysis checks for meaning and consistency in the code.

## What I've Learned

* **Type Checking:** I wrote Python functions to simulate type checking.
* **Symbol Tables:** I implemented a symbol table using a Python dictionary.
* **Scope:** I manually traced variable scopes.

## Symbol Table Example

(Include an example of how you used a dictionary as a symbol table)

## Type Checking Example

(Include an example of your type checking code)

## Next Steps

* Implement more robust semantic analysis features.
* Explore attribute grammars.
